# ember-cli-bourbon

Include bourbon in an ember-cli app.

## Dependencies

Your project should already be set up to handle sass/scss builds. If you're not, do so by running:

    ember install ember-cli-sass

## Usage

In your ember-cli (>= 0.1.1) project, run:

    ember install ember-cli-bourbon

The generator will create an `app.scss` with the sole contents being:

    @import "bourbon";

If you already have content in your `app.scss`, you can add that line to the top of `app.scss` yourself.
